Susano'o
====
A simple, fast, structured library that takes the pain out of writing ADO.NET by eliminating boiler plate code and providing SQL result mappings to strongly-typed objects with no attributing or baseclass/interface, just pure POCOs and fast! 

#####How does it work?
Susanoo uses Linq expression trees to dynamically write and compile code to map your objects before the command ever executes, leaving your SQL calls unaffected.
